    <p class="text-center">Currently (May '16) I am busy becoming a <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/program" class="text-url">full stack web developer</a>. I am eager to learn and further develop myself as a programmer. I also consider myself to be a creative centipede with an interst solving entrepreneurial problems with tech solutions.</p>

    <p>My thesis subject: How does blended education benefit students study results opposed to solely in class courses. </p>

  <h2>Summary of me</h2>
    <p class="text-center"> I have always been busy in an entrepreneurial manner. For example, I sold beverages to pedestrians and later at the age of 13 I made close to EUR 10,000 in an online trading game. As a teenager, I set up my first company selling hair gel capsules via vending machines at airports, sport clubs, pubs and more. Some 6 years later I started a company that mediates between customers and catering services. During my time at Nyenrode I received prizes and grants for my start up concept of digitalizing the Dutch education system. Working out this idea, with external- and school’s cooperation, was a valuable experience and a pool of knowledge.</p>

    <p> I am always busy learning new things and eager to explore new roads. I have a strong interest for innovative online/technological solutions.</p>

    <p> I am goal oriented, adaptive, determined and rational on the other side I have an eye for detail and enjoy working with team members. I can illustrate myself as a creative centipede, always musing over possible “creative” solutions. I honor honesty, respect and loyalty yet I am not fond of authoritative behavior and a non-pro active mentality. I enjoy thinking outside the box and people who do so as well.</p>

    <p>Once focused internally I am able to deal with things in a rational and logical way, once external I take things primarily via intuition. I look at things on how they can be improved. I have the ability to analyze problems, identify patterns and create logical explanations. My approach to theories is enthusiastic yet skeptic, ignoring existing rules and opinions and denying my own approach to the resolution.</p>
